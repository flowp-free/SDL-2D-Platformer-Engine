# SDL-2D-Platformer-Engine
Learning C++ and SDL 


This project began as an attempt to create a 2D platformer game. However, during the initial exploration, I found that most existing game engines were either overly bloated, lacked native C++ support, or did not offer a true 2D environmentâ€”instead relying on workarounds to simulate 2D space.

As development progressed, the project naturally evolved into a game engine in its own right. While it originated as a game, it has since shifted focus toward providing a lightweight, C++-based 2D engine. Some basic assets and character demos are included to showcase the engine's current capabilities.
